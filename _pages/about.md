I am [Paguiel Nganji](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paguiel-nganji/), I am actualy studing **Electrical Engineering and Industrial Computing**,  and I am passionate about engineering in general and aerospace in particular. I specialize in automation, electronics, embedded systems, and hyperfrequency.

  This page presents my academic background and some personal projects. It is a way for me to put my knowledge into practice and share my progress.
  There are examples of my work on my [Github profile](https://github.com/paguielng), such as rocket projects and small electronic gadgets. Each project is an opportunity to learn and improve my skills in solving technical challenges.

A resource-driven personal work
======
To do this, I continuously explore tools and methods that are standard in the industry. I use some popular tools:
- [C/C++](https://isocpp.org/) for performance-critical embedded applications.
- [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) for schematizing electronic circuit
- [Git/GitHub](https://github.com/paguielng/) for managing my projects
- [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/) for online ESP32 simulator
- [MatLab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html/) for computing simulations
- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for mathematical equations
- [Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.com/fr/products/fusion-360/overview/) for CAO software modeler

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](https://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

**Create content & metadata**

For site content, there is one Markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a Markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each Markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

For more info
------
More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
